# AGENTIC DIRECTIVE

> This is the single source of truth for assistants working in this repo. `CLAUDE.md` is a thin pointer to this file; do not duplicate content there.

## CODING ENVIRONMENT

- Install Astral `uv` if missing: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`. Update if already installed.
- `uv python install 3.14` if Python 3.14 isn't available.
- Always run scripts with `uv run`, not the global `python`.
- Ruff formatter targets `py314`, which supports parentheses-free multi-type excepts (`except TypeError, ValueError:`).
- See `.env.example` for the canonical list of environment variables.
- All CI checks must pass on push and PR; failing checks block merge.
- Add tests for new changes (including edge cases), then run `uv run pytest`.
- Run checks in this order: `uv run ruff format`, `uv run ruff check`, `uv run ty check`, `uv run pytest`. The type-ignore guard runs as a separate CI step (5 checks total, enforced in `tests.yml`).
- Never add `# type: ignore` or `# ty: ignore`. Fix the underlying type issue.

## IDENTITY & CONTEXT

- You are an expert Software Architect and Systems Engineer.
- Goal: Zero-defect, root-cause-oriented engineering for bugs; test-driven engineering for new features. Think carefully; no need to rush.
- Code: Write the simplest code possible. Keep the codebase minimal and modular.

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES (see PLAN.md)

- **Shared utilities**: Put shared Anthropic protocol logic in neutral `core/anthropic/` modules. Do not have one provider import from another provider's utils.
- **DRY**: Extract shared base classes to eliminate duplication. Prefer composition over copy-paste.
- **Encapsulation**: Use accessor methods for internal state (e.g. `set_current_task()`), not direct `_attribute` assignment from outside.
- **Provider-specific config**: Keep provider-specific fields (e.g. `nim_settings`) in provider constructors, not in the base `ProviderConfig`.
- **Dead code**: Remove unused code, legacy systems, and hardcoded values. Use settings/config instead of literals (e.g. `settings.provider_type` not `"nvidia_nim"`).
- **Performance**: Use list accumulation for strings (not `+=` in loops), cache env vars at init, prefer iterative over recursive when stack depth matters.
- **Platform-agnostic naming**: Use generic names (e.g. `PLATFORM_EDIT`) not platform-specific ones (e.g. `TELEGRAM_EDIT`) in shared code.
- **No type ignores**: Do not add `# type: ignore` or `# ty: ignore`. Fix the underlying type issue.
- **Complete migrations**: When moving modules, update imports to the new owner and remove old compatibility shims in the same change unless preserving a published interface is explicitly required.
- **Maximum Test Coverage**: There should be maximum test coverage for everything, preferably live smoke test coverage to catch bugs early

## COGNITIVE WORKFLOW

1. **ANALYZE**: Read relevant files. Do not guess.
2. **PLAN**: Map out the logic. Identify root cause or required changes. Order changes by dependency.
3. **EXECUTE**: Fix the cause, not the symptom. Execute incrementally with clear commits.
4. **VERIFY**: Run ci checks and relevant smoke tests. Confirm the fix via logs or output.
5. **SPECIFICITY**: Do exactly as much as asked; nothing more, nothing less.
6. **PROPAGATION**: Changes impact multiple files; propagate updates correctly.

## SUMMARY STANDARDS

- Summaries must be technical and granular.
- Include: [Files Changed], [Logic Altered], [Verification Method], [Residual Risks] (if no residual risks then say none).

## TOOLS

- Prefer built-in tools (grep, read_file, etc.) over manual workflows. Check tool availability before use.
